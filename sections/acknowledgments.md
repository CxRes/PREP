# Acknowledgments
{:numbered="false"}

I would like to express my gratitude to Tim Berners-Lee for his recommendation to the IRTF for the Diversity Travel Grant that allowed me to first present this draft at IETF 118. I would like to thank IRTF, and in particular, the selection committee for the Diversity Travel Grants for sponsoring my visit to the co-located IRTF and IETF meetings in Prague. I would also like to acknowledge the help and guidance from Dhruv Dhody that allowed me to make the trip.

I would like to thank Alain Bourgeois for his continued help in implementing the {{&protocol}} in the Node Solid Server. I am also grateful to the Solid community for their support and encouragement of this work.
